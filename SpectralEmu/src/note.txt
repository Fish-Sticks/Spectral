Address modes (In depth, page 15):

ACCUMULATOR ADDRESSING - This-form of addressing is represented with a one byte instruction, implying an
operation on the accumulator.

IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING - In immediate addressing, the operand is contained in the second byte of the instruction,
with no further memory addressing required.

ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING - In absolute addressing, the second byte of the instruction specifies the eight low order
bits of the effective address while the third byte specifies the eight high order bits. Thus, the
absolute addressing mode allows access to the entire 65K bytes of addressable memory.

ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING - The zero page instructions allow for shorter code and execution times by only fetching
the second byte of the instruction and assuming a zero high address byte. Careful use of the zero
page can result in significant increase in code efficiency.

INDEXED ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING - (X, Y indexing) - This form of addressing is used in conjunction with the index
register and is referred to as "Zero Page, X" or "Zero Page, Y". The effective address is calculated
by adding the second byte to the contents of the index register. Since this is a form of "Zero Page"
. addressing, the content of the second byte references a location in page zero. Additionally due to
the "Zero Page" addressing nature of this mode, no carry is added to the high order 8 bits of memory
and crossing of page boundaries does not occur.

INDEXED ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING - (X, Y indexing) - This form of addressing is used in conjunction with X and Y
index register and is referred to as "Absolute, X", and "Absolute, Y". The effective address is
formed by adding the contents of X or Y to the address contained in the second and third bytes of the
instruction. This mode allows the index register to contain the index or count value and the in¬
struction to contain the base address. This type of indexing allows any location referencing and
the index to modify multiple fields resulting in reduced coding and execution time.

IMPLIED ADDRESSING - In the implied addressing mode, the address containing the operand is implicitly stated
in the operation code of the instruction.

RELATIVE ADDRESSING - Relative addressing is used only with branch instructions and establishes a destination
for the conditional branch.
The second byte of the instruction becomes the operand which is an "Offset" added to the contents of
the lower eight bits of the program counter when the counter is set at the next instruction. The
range of the offset is -128 to +127 bytes from the ne''t instruction.

INDEXED INDIRECT ADDRESSING - In indexed indirect addressing (referred to as (Indirect,X)), the second byte of
the instruction is added to the contents of the X index register, discarding the carry. The result
of this addition points to a memory location on page zero whose contents is the low order eight bits
of the effective address. The next memory location in page zero contains the high order eight bits
of the effective address. Both memory locations specifying the high and low order bytes of the
effective address must be in page zero.

INDIRECT INDEXED ADDRESSING - In indirect indexed addressing (referred to as (Indirect),Y), the second byte
of the instruction points to a memory location in page zero. The contents of this memory location
is added to the contents of the Y index register, the result being the low order eight bits of the
effective address. The carry from this addition is added to the contents of the next page zero
memory location, the result being the high order eight bits of the effective address.

ABSOLUTE INDIRECT - The second byte of the instruction contains the low order eight bits of a memory location.
The high order eight bits of that memory location is contained in the third byte of the instruction.
The contents of the fully specified memory location is the low order byte of the effective address.
The next memory location contains the high order byte of the effective address which is loaded
into the sixteen bits of the program counter.
